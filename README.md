# LoopingAudio_net

Music player built in C# designed for looping a favorite section of your song repeatedly, without the need to manually rewind.

Music files can saved to an sqlite database to quickly load the song and the interval points of it.


# What I've learned while making this

* More about C# Events and how they work.
* Working with an Audio Library
* Properly Deploying a WinForm app. For now, I can only deploy to a removeable media, but in the future, I want to have a file share path so any user can download it seemlessly from the Internet.
