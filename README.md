# LoopingAudio_net

Music player built in C# designed for looping a favorite section of your song repeatedly, without the need to manually rewind.

Music files can saved to an sqlite database to quickly load the song and the interval points of it.

# Version 
.NET Framework 4.7.8

# Releases
What is shown on the Releases Tab will not work properly when run. For now, I can only deploy this software from a removeable media, but in the future, I want to have a file share path so any user can download it seemlessly from the Internet.

# What I've learned while making this

* More about C# Events and how they work.
* Working with an Audio Library
