//BUGS TO FIX
//1, After a few frames, lblEndPoint.Text is changed to the total length of media from the initial EndPoint text
//endpoint if the media was retrieved from the database [FIXED]

/*
 I've tried everything I can think of, nothing works

1. Adjusting variables and methods before and after other variables
2. Calling the .PerformClick() Method
3. Exposing the button as "internal" then calling the .PerformClick() button in another form

I find it very strange how the integer value of the length of the media is consistent,
but the string representation of that string isn't.

I FIXED IT
After a good night's sleep, I thought off where I do I use the lblEndPoint in my code and one of
the locations is inside the MediaOpened Event, which is fired after the database opens the media

That was the place that changes the string, but there is no change to the integer represenation

//2, BECAUSE OF MY INHERITANCE CHANGE, IF I HOLD DOWN ON MUSICBAR, THE PLAYHEAD WILL BE PAUSED
//REGARLDESS IF THE PLAYHEAD HAS BEEN PAUSED BEFORE OR NOT

//I might have to just revert the changes, or else I'll end up exposing the private bool member
//which defeats the purpose of this. ["FIXED"] I did just that. No extended class
